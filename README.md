# Java Developer Internship – Task 1

## Objective
The objective of this task is to set up the Java development environment and create the first executable Java program using basic Java concepts.

## Tools Used
- Java JDK 21 (OpenJDK)
- Eclipse IDE
- Command Prompt (CMD)
- GitHub

## Task Description
This task involves verifying the Java installation, creating a basic Java program with a `main()` method, compiling it using the Java compiler, and executing it from the command line. The program also demonstrates how to accept and display command-line arguments.

## Project Structure

│── src/
│ └── HelloJava.java
│── bin/
│ └── HelloJava.class
│── .classpath
│── .project
│── .settings/

│── README.md

## Program Description
The `HelloJava` program prints a welcome message and checks for command-line arguments. If arguments are provided during execution, the program displays them one by one. If no arguments are passed, it prints an appropriate message.

## How to Compile and Run
Open the Command Prompt in the `src` directory and run the following commands:

    ```bash
       javac HelloJava.java
       java HelloJava Akshu Java Intern 

## Output

Hello, Java Developer Internship!
Command-line arguments received:
Argument 1: Akshu
Argument 2: Java
Argument 3: Intern

## Learning Outcome

Understood the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM

Learned how Java source code is compiled into bytecode

Executed a Java program using the command line

Learned how to pass command-line arguments in Java

Gained hands-on experience with Java project structure and GitHub submission
